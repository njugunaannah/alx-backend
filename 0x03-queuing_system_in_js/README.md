# Queuing System in JavaScript

A queuing system is a fundamental concept in computer science that allows you to manage and process tasks in a sequential order. In JavaScript, you can implement a queuing system using arrays and built-in array methods.

## Implementation

To implement a queuing system in JavaScript, you can use the following steps:

1. Create an empty array to serve as the queue.

2. To add an element to the queue, use the `push()` method to add the element to the end of the array.

3. To remove an element from the queue, use the `shift()` method to remove the first element from the array.

4. To access the element at the front of the queue without removing it, use the index `0`.

Here's an example implementation of a queuing system in JavaScript:
